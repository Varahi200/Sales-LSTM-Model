## Introduction
Sales forecasting is crucial for inventory management, budgeting, and planning. This project leverages LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series data, to predict future sales based on past sales records.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- LSTM model implementation using TensorFlow and Keras
- Training and validation pipeline
- Evaluation metrics and visualization

  ## Model Architecture
- An input layer
- Three LSTM layers
- Dropout layer
- An output layer predicting future sales

   ## Results
- A mean absolute error of 4771
